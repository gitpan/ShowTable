ShowTable.pm is a Perl 5 module which defines subroutines
to print arrays of data in a nicely formatted listing, using one of
four possible formats: simple table, boxed table, list style, and
HTML-formatting (for World-Wide-Web output).  See the documentation
on ShowTable.pm for details on the formatting.

The program "showtable" reads tab (or other character) delimited data
from a file, or STDIN, and columnizes the data within, and then feeds
the array of data to the ShowTable module for display.  In other words,
showtable is a data formatter program.  Using the '-html' option,
showtable can accept ASCII tablular data and format it appropriately
for display through a Web-browser.

Both the the ShowTable.pm module and the showtable program have
embedded POD text with which man or HTML pages can be created.

For detailed usage information, you can do:

    pod2man ShowTable.pm | nroff -man 
    pod2man showtable    | nroff -man

The program and module are accompanied with a Makefile, this README, a
test program (test.pl), a reference test output file, and the GNU
License, under which this software is freely available.

The archive is available on:

    ftp://hub.ucsb.edu/pub/prog/perl/ShowTable.tar.gz

where $VER is the latest version.
